# Iris Cornr 
Cornr, also known as Irisweb is a Web browser base built in Windows Forms and C# that uses Webview2 (`Microsoft.Web.WebView2`) to run it. it is simple and fast with it's base code, but when you clone it, we hope you give it a third trait: strong!

the browser is very simple, with only 6 input parts: **Back**, **Foward**, **Add Tab**, **Delete Tab**, **Go**, and **`txtAddressBar`**
